Mantha (Dragon): Morning Hype. It's my birthday today, I am really looking forward to one of your magical dragon cakes at the party this afternoon!
Hype: Hi Mantha, Happy Birthday! How old are you today?
Mantha: Oh a lady dragon never reveals her age, do you have all the ingredients for the cake?
Hype: *looks in cupboard* oh no! It looks like someone has used all my ingredients.
Mantha: I wouldn't know anything about that, maybe ask your mum...
Hype: *walks over to Hera* Hey mum, do you know what happened to all my ingredients? I need to make a cake for Mantha, but the kitchen cupboard is empty.
Hera (Mum): Sorry Hype, I made some cookies for myself yesterday and ate them all *looks shifty*. I forgot it was Mantha's birthday today.
Theon (Dad): Hera! How could you?! You didn't even give me any!
Hype: It's fine dad I will go out and collect some more, let me look at my list...
*list appears with ingredients required*
Hera: OK darling, be careful. I can't wait to taste your cake!
Theon: See you soon sweetie, let me know if you need any help.*whispers* Better not let your mum near the cake later - she'll eat it all.
Hera: Oi, Theon! I heard that!
